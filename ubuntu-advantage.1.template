.SH SERVICES
.TP
.B "Anbox Cloud (anbox-cloud)"
Anbox Cloud lets you stream mobile apps securely, at any scale, to any device,
letting you focus on your apps. Run Android in system containers on public or
private clouds with ultra low streaming latency. When the anbox-cloud service
is enabled, by default, the Appliance variant is enabled. Enabling this service
allows orchestration to provision a PPA with the Anbox Cloud resources. This
step also configures the Anbox Management Service (AMS) with the necessary
image server credentials.

To learn more about Anbox Cloud, see https://anbox-cloud.io

.TP
.B "Common Criteria EAL2 Provisioning (cc-eal)"
Common Criteria is an Information Technology Security Evaluation standard
(ISO/IEC IS 15408) for computer security certification. Ubuntu 16.04 has been
evaluated to assurance level EAL2 through CSEC. The evaluation was performed
on Intel x86_64, IBM Power8 and IBM Z hardware platforms.

.TP
.B "CIS Audit (cis)/Ubuntu Security Guide (usg)"
Ubuntu Security Guide is a tool for hardening and auditing, allowing for
environment-specific customizations. It enables compliance with profiles such
as DISA-STIG and the CIS benchmarks.

.TP
.B "Expanded Security Maintenance for Infrastructure (esm-infra)"
Expanded Security Maintenance for Infrastructure provides access to a private
PPA which includes available high and critical CVE fixes for Ubuntu LTS
packages in the Ubuntu Main repository between the end of the standard Ubuntu
LTS security maintenance and its end of life. It is enabled by default with
Ubuntu Pro.

You can find out more about the service at https://ubuntu.com/security/esm

.TP
.B "Expanded Security Maintenance for Applications (esm-apps)"
Expanded Security Maintenance for Applications is enabled by default on
entitled workloads. It provides access to a private PPA which includes
available high and critical CVE fixes for Ubuntu LTS packages in the Ubuntu
Main and Ubuntu Universe repositories from the Ubuntu LTS release date until
its end of life.

You can find out more about the esm service at https://ubuntu.com/security/esm

.TP
.B "FIPS 140-2 certified modules (fips)"
Installs FIPS 140 crypto packages for FedRAMP, FISMA and compliance use cases.
Note that "fips" does not provide security patching. For FIPS certified
modules with security patches please see "fips-updates". If you are unsure,
choose "fips-updates" for maximum security.

Find out more at https://ubuntu.com/security/fips


.TP
.B "FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates (fips-updates)"
fips-updates installs FIPS 140 crypto packages including all security patches
for those modules that have been provided since their certification date.

.TP
.B "Landscape (landscape)"
Landscape Client can be installed on this machine and enrolled in Canonical's
Landscape SaaS: https://landscape.canonical.com or a self-hosted Landscape:
https://ubuntu.com/landscape/install

Landscape allows you to manage many machines as easily as one, with an
intuitive dashboard and API interface for automation, hardening, auditing, and
more.

Find out more about Landscape at https://ubuntu.com/landscape

.TP
.B "Livepatch Service (livepatch)"
Livepatch provides selected high and critical kernel CVE fixes and other
non-security bug fixes as kernel livepatches. Livepatches are applied without
rebooting a machine which drastically limits the need for unscheduled system
reboots. Due to the nature of fips compliance, livepatches cannot be enabled
on fips-enabled systems.

You can find out more about Ubuntu Kernel Livepatch service at https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch

.TP
.B "ROS ESM Security Updates (ros)"
ros provides access to a private PPA which includes security-related updates
for available high and critical CVE fixes for Robot Operating System (ROS)
packages. For access to ROS ESM and security updates, both esm-infra and
esm-apps services will also be enabled. To get additional non-security updates,
enable ros-updates.

You can find out more about the ROS ESM service at https://ubuntu.com/robotics/ros-esm


.TP
.B "ROS ESM All Updates (ros-updates)"
ros-updates provides access to a private PPA that includes non-security-related
updates for Robot Operating System (ROS) packages. For full access to ROS ESM,
security and non-security updates, the esm-infra, esm-apps, and ros services
will also be enabled.

.SH PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on Azure and GCP) to
detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If an Ubuntu Pro license
is detected, then the machine is automatically attached.
If you are uninterested in Ubuntu Pro services, you can safely stop and disable the
daemon using systemctl:

sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service
sudo systemctl disable ubuntu-advantage.service

.SH TIMER JOBS
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed
recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides
which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run
successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.
There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchronize job execution
time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized
calls to the same service.

Current jobs being checked and executed are:
