# Putting debhelper first allows a successful build on recent releases without requiring --resolve-alternatives during sbuild.

# IMPORTANT: ubuntu-pro-client does not "Provide" ubuntu-advantage-tools
# At the time of the rename, existing releases with ubuntu-advantage-tools
# include xenial, bionic, focal, jammy, and mantic.
# We cannot allow ubuntu-advantage-tools <<31 to be removed on those releases,
# because it could break ESM (remove sources.list entries in prerm).
# On those releases, ubuntu-minimal (and ubuntu-cloud-minimal) Depends on
# ubuntu-advantage-tools, which prevents it from being removed without also
# removing ubuntu-minimal or ubuntu-cloud-minimal. We consider that to be a
# sufficient warning to users that removing ubuntu-advantage-tools is not
# supported.
# If ubuntu-pro-client were to "Provide" ubuntu-advantage-tools, then that
# mechanism would not work, and users could remove ubuntu-advantage-tools
# accidentally.
# ubuntu-pro-client could "Provide" ubuntu-advantage-tools in releases in the
# future, but it would not add any value over having the ubuntu-advantage-tools
# transitional dummy package.
