# After debhelper 13.3 we no longer need dh-systemd.
# On hirsute and later, dh-systemd doesn't even exist.
# On recent releases, the first alternative will be used.
# On older releases (where debhelper is older than 13.3 and we need dh-systemd), the second alternative is used.
# Putting debhelper first allows a successful build on recent releases without requiring --resolve-alternatives during sbuild.

# We need golang>=1.14 to support riscv64 builds for Focal+
# We always want to prefer the golang-go package, because it is not pinned to a certain version, so it is first.
# On Focal, golang-go is at 1.13 but golang-1.14-go is available, so that is second.
# Xenial and Bionic don't need to support riscv64, but do need to support our tests which require >=1.7.
# golang-1.10-go is available on both Xenial and Bionic, so that is third.
