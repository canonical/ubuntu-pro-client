# On hirsute and later, dh-systemd doesn't even exist.
# On recent releases, the first alternative will be used.
# On older releases (where debhelper is older than 13.3 and we need dh-systemd), the second alternative is used.
# Putting debhelper first allows a successful build on recent releases without requiring --resolve-alternatives during sbuild.
