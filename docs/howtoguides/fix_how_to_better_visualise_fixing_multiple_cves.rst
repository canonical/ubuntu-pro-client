How to preview the results when fixing multiple CVEs
****************************************************

To fix multiple CVEs, you need to use the ``u.pro.security.fix.cve.execute.v1``
endpoint, as the CLI ``pro fix`` command doesn't support multiple CVEs. However,
as can be seen in the
:ref:`endpoint documentation<references/api:u.pro.security.fix.cve.execute.v1>`,
this command will output a JSON blob containing the results of the ``fix``
operation for each CVE.

This doesn't allow for a quick visualisation of the ``fix`` status of each
requested CVE. To address that, you can use a ``jq`` filter. The ``jq`` command
is mainly used to parse JSON data directly in the terminal. To learn more about
it, refer to the ``jq`` `manpage`_.

Before proceeding, you need to ensure that ``jq`` is installed on your machine.
This can be achieved by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq -y

Now that ``jq`` is installed, you can properly parse the JSON data delivered
from the ``execute`` API endpoint. As an example, let's try to fix these three
CVEs: **CVE-2020-28196**, **CVE-2020-15180** and **CVE-2017-9233**.
To do that, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pro api u.pro.security.fix.cve.execute.v1 --data '{"cves": ["CVE-2020-28196", "CVE-2020-15180", "CVE-2017-9233"]}' \
      | jq -r '.data.attributes.cves_data.cves[] | "\(.title) (\(.description)) - \(.status)"'

We can see that the command output will be something that follows this
structure here:

.. code-block:: bash

    CVE-2020-28196 (Kerberos vulnerability) - fixed
    CVE-2020-15180 (MariaDB vulnerabilities) - not-affected
    CVE-2017-9233 (Coin3D vulnerability) - fixed

Note that each entry in this output consists of three fields:

* **CVE NAME**: The name of the CVE
* **CVE DESCRIPTION**: The description of the CVE
* **CVE STATUS**: The status of the CVE which can be one of: **fixed, still-affected, not-affected**
  and **affected-until-reboot**.

If you want to change the output format, you can tweak the ``jq`` filter. For
example, to only show the CVE title and status, you can change the ``jq``
filter to:

.. code-block:: bash

    jq -r '.data.attributes.cves_data.cves[] | "\(.title) - \(.status)"'

Finally, if you want to have the same visualisation when fixing USNs, change
the ``jq`` filter to:

.. code-block:: bash

    jq -r '.data.attributes.usns_data.usns[] | "\(.title) (\(.description)) - \(.status)"'
