How to update vulnerability data on the machine?
************************************************

When running the ``pro vulnerability list`` you might see an alert like this:

.. code-block:: text

    The vulnerabilities data used in the system is outdated by NUM days/hours
    To update the data please run with --update:

        pro vulnerability list --update

This behaviour can happen when running ``pro vulnerability show``. This indicates
that our data source for the vulnerability commands is outdated in the machine.

To update it, you can follow the instructions mentioned in the warning or you
can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pro vulnerability update

The main purpose of this command is to only update that datasource.
When we detect a new version of this datasource, you should see an output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Checking for the availability of newer vulnerability data.
    Please wait a moment while we verify if a new version is ready for download.
    
    Found a newer version of the data.
    Fetching and processing the new data…
    
    ✔ Vulnerability data in the system is now up-to-date

And if you there is no new version of the datasource:

.. code-block:: text

    Checking for the availability of newer vulnerability data.
    Please wait a moment while we verify if a new version is ready for download.
    
    ✔ Vulnerability data in the system is already up-to-date
