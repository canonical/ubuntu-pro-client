How to configure a proxy
************************

The Ubuntu Pro Client can be configured to use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy as needed
for network requests. It will also honour the ``no_proxy`` environment variable
(if set) to avoid using local proxies for certain outbound traffic. In
addition, the Ubuntu Pro Client will automatically set up proxies for all
programs required for enabling Ubuntu Pro services. This includes APT, snaps,
and Livepatch.

.. note::

    Throughout this guide, we will set the HTTPS proxy with an http prefix.
    However, depending on your proxy setup, you might need to configure the
    Pro HTTPS proxy with a https prefix.

HTTP/HTTPS proxies
==================

To configure standard HTTP and/or HTTPS proxies, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config set http_proxy=http://host:port
   $ sudo pro config set https_proxy=http://host:port

After running the above commands, Ubuntu Pro Client will:

1. Verify that the proxy is working by using it to reach ``api.snapcraft.io``
2. Configure itself to use the given proxy for all future network requests
3. Configure ``snapd`` (if ``snapd`` is installed) to use the given proxy
4. Configure Livepatch (if Livepatch has already been enabled) to use the given
   proxy:

   1. If Livepatch is enabled after the ``config`` command, Ubuntu Pro Client
      will configure Livepatch to use the given proxy at that time.

To remove HTTP/HTTPS proxy configuration, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config unset http_proxy
   $ sudo pro config unset https_proxy

After running the above commands, Ubuntu Pro Client will also remove proxy
configuration from ``snapd`` (if installed) and Livepatch (if enabled).

APT proxies
===========

APT proxy settings are configured separately. To have Ubuntu Pro Client manage
your global APT proxy configuration, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config set global_apt_http_proxy=http://host:port
   $ sudo pro config set global_apt_https_proxy=http://host:port

After running the above commands, Ubuntu Pro Client will:

1. Verify that the proxy works by using it to reach ``archive.ubuntu.com`` or
   ``esm.ubuntu.com``.
2. Configure APT to use the given proxy by writing an apt configuration file to
   ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy``.

.. caution::

   Any configuration file that comes later in the ``apt.conf.d`` directory
   could override the proxy configured by the Ubuntu Pro Client.

To remove the APT proxy configuration, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config unset global_apt_http_proxy
   $ sudo pro config unset global_apt_https_proxy

.. note::

   Starting in Pro Client version 27.9, APT proxy config options changed.
   The old settings: ``apt_http_proxy`` and ``apt_https_proxy`` will still
   work and will be treated the same as ``global_apt_http_proxy`` and
   ``global_apt_https_proxy``, respectively.

Pro-service-only APT proxies
----------------------------

To set an APT proxy that will only be used for Ubuntu Pro services, use the
following commands instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config set ua_apt_http_proxy=http://host:port
   $ sudo pro config set ua_apt_https_proxy=http://host:port

Authenticate your proxy server
==============================

If your proxy server requires authentication, you can pass the credentials
directly in the URL when setting the configuration, as in:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config set https_proxy=https://username:password@host:port

Check the configuration
=======================

To see which proxies Ubuntu Pro Client is currently configured to use, you can
use the ``show`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pro config show

The above will output something that looks like the following if there are
proxies set:

.. code-block:: text

   http_proxy             http://proxy
   https_proxy            http://proxy
   global_apt_http_proxy  http://aptproxy
   global_apt_https_proxy http://aptproxy

Or it may look like this if there are no proxies set:

.. code-block:: text

   http_proxy             None
   https_proxy            None
   global_apt_http_proxy  None
   global_apt_https_proxy None
