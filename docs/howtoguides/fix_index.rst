Handle vulnerabilities
**********************

Using the Pro Client, you can handle individual vulnerabilities (both CVEs and
USNs) that may be affecting your machine. You can also preview what will happen
if you run the ``pro fix`` command on a specific vulnerability, and control
if related USNs are fixed.

* :ref:`Use pro fix to resolve a CVE or USN <pro-fix-resolve-cve>`
* :ref:`Preview pro fix results <pro-fix-dry-run>`
* :ref:`Skip fixing related USNs <pro-fix-skip-related>`

You can also resolve multiple vulnerabilities at once using the API.
