Check the status of the services
================================

After you have :ref:`attached your subscription <attach>` and
updated the ``ubuntu-advantage-tools`` package, you can check which services
are enabled by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pro status

This will show you which services are enabled or disabled on your machine
(output truncated for brevity):

.. code-block:: text

    SERVICE          ENTITLED  STATUS    DESCRIPTION
    esm-apps         yes       enabled   Expanded Security Maintenance for Applications
    esm-infra        yes       enabled   Expanded Security Maintenance for Infrastructure
    livepatch        yes       enabled   Canonical Livepatch service
    realtime-kernel  yes       disabled  Ubuntu kernel with PREEMPT_RT patches integrated
