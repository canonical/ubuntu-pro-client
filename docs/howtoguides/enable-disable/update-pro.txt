Make sure ``pro`` is up-to-date
===============================

All systems come with ``pro`` pre-installed through the
``ubuntu-pro-client`` package. To make sure that you're running the latest
version of ``pro``, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-pro-client
