How to provide a manifest file to pro vulnerability commands
************************************************************

Let's assume that you want to verify the vulnerability situation of a different
machine than the one you are using. You can achieve that by providing a **manifest file**
to either ``pro vulnerability show`` or ``pro vulnerability list`` by providing the flag ``--manifest-file``. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   pro vulnerability list --manifest-file=MANIFEST_FILE_PATH

When providing a manifest file to either of the commands, it is assumed
that the manifest file was generated for the **same** Ubuntu series the
the machine is running on. For example, if you run the command on a Xenial
machine, and provide a manifest file for the command, the command will assume that the
manifest also represents a Xenial machine. If that is not the case, you must
provide the ``--series`` parameter to the command as well, to provide the Ubuntu series the
manifest was generated on, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   pro vulnerability list --manifest-file=MANIFEST_FILE_PATH --series=focal

Currently, we only support manifest files generated by the Pro Client. This
manifest file can be generated by using the
:ref:`package_manifest<references/api:u.security.package_manifest.v1>` API endpoint.
