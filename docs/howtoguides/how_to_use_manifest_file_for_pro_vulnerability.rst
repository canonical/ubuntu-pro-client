How to provide a manifest file to pro vulnerability commands
************************************************************

If you want to provide a manifest file to either ``pro vulnerability show`` or
``pro vulnerability list``, you can use the flag ``--manifest-file``. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   pro vulnerability list --manifest-file=MANIFEST_FILE_PATH

Now, be aware that when providing a manifest file to either of the commands, we will
interpret that the manifest file was generated for the **same** ubuntu release the
the machine is running on. For example, if you are running on the command on Xenial
machine and provides a manifest for the command, the command will believe that the
manifest also represents a Xenial machine. If that is not the case, you **need** to
provide the ``--series`` parameter to the command as well, to provide the command
with the ubuntu release the manifest was generated on, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   pro vulnerability list --manifest-file=MANIFEST_FILE_PATH --series=focal

Finally, today we only support the manifest file generated by the Pro client. This
manifest file can be generated by using the
:ref:`package_manifest<references/api:u.security.package_manifest.v1>` API endpoint.
