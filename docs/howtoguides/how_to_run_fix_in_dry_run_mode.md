# How to run the `fix` command in "dry run" mode

If you are unsure on what changes will happen on your system after you run
`pro fix` to address a CVE/USN, you can simulate a run using the `--dry-run`
flag to see which packages will be installed on the system. For example, this
is the output of running `pro fix USN-5079-2 --dry-run`:

```
WARNING: The option --dry-run is being used.
No packages will be installed when running this command.
USN-5079-2: curl vulnerabilities
Found CVEs:
https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-22946
https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-22947
1 affected source package is installed: curl
(1/1) curl:
A fix is available in Ubuntu Pro: ESM Infra.
The machine is not attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription.
To proceed with the fix, a prompt would ask for a valid Ubuntu Pro token.
{ pro attach TOKEN }
Ubuntu Pro service: esm-infra is not enabled.
To proceed with the fix, a prompt would ask permission to automatically enable
this service.
{ pro enable esm-infra }
{ apt update && apt install --only-upgrade -y curl libcurl3-gnutls }
âœ” USN-5079-2 is resolved.
```

You can see that using `--dry-run` will also indicate which actions would need
to happen to completely address the USN/CVE. Here we can see that the package
fix can only be accessed through the `esm-infra` service. Therefore, we need an
Ubuntu Pro subscription, as can be seen in this part of the output:

```
The machine is not attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription.
To proceed with the fix, a prompt would ask for a valid Ubuntu Pro token.
{ pro attach TOKEN }
```

Additionally, it informs you that even with a subscription, we need the specific
`esm-infra` service to be enabled:

```
Ubuntu Pro service: esm-infra is not enabled.
To proceed with the fix, a prompt would ask permission to automatically enable
this service.
{ pro enable esm-infra }
```

```{note}
After performing these steps during a `fix` command without `--dry-run`, your
machine should no longer be affected by the USN we used as an example.
```
