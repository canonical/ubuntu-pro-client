Attach a machine to a subscription
**********************************

To access Ubuntu Pro services, you need to attach your machine to a
subscription. The most common way to attach a single machine is using
``pro attach``:

* :ref:`How to attach <attach>`

If you have a paid subscription and want to check a specific token to see what
will happen if you attach to it, you can simulate the attach operation (without
making changes to your machine):

* :ref:`How to simulate attaching <simulate-attach>`

It's also possible to pass a specific token to your machine using a
configuration file:

* :ref:`Attach using a config file <attach-with-config>`
