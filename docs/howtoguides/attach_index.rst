Attaching machines
******************

To access Ubuntu Pro services, you need to first attach your machine to a
subscription:

* :ref:`How to attach <attach>`

You can also simulate attaching to a specific token, to check what will happen
without making changes to your machine:

* :ref:`How to simulate attaching <simulate-attach>`

It's also possible to pass a specific token to your machine using a
configuration file:

* :ref:`Attach using a config file <attach-with-config>`

You can also use your Ubuntu Pro subscription across multiple machines:

* :ref:`Attach multiple machines <attach_multiple_machines>`
