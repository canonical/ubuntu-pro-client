Install Multipass
=================

In this tutorial, we will use a Xenial Multipass virtual machine (VM) to avoid
making any modifications to your machine. We have chosen `Multipass`_ for this
tutorial because it allows us to easily launch VMs without requiring any
complicated setup.

To install Multipass on your computer, run the following command on your
machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo snap install multipass
