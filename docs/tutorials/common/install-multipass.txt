Install Multipass
=================

To avoid making any modifications to your live system during the tutorial, we
will set up a virtual machine using `Multipass`_. We are using Multipass
because it allows us to launch VMs without needing any complicated setup. To
install Multipass on your system, run the following command on your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo snap install multipass
