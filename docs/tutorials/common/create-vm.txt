Create the Xenial Multipass VM
==============================

Now that we have installed Multipass, we can launch our Multipass VM by running
this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ multipass launch xenial --name dev-x

Now we can access the VM by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ multipass shell dev-x

Notice that when you run this command, your terminal username and hostname
change to:

.. code-block::

    ubuntu@dev-x

This indicates that you are now inside the VM.

Finally, let's run ``apt update`` and ``apt upgrade`` on the VM to make sure we
are operating on the correct version of Xenial:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-advantage-tools
    
From now on, every time we say: "run the command" our intention is for you to
run that command inside your VM.
