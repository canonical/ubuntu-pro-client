# Create an Ubuntu FIPS Docker image

```{attention}

This tutorial requires at least Ubuntu Pro Client version 27.7 -- to check what
version of the Pro Client you are using, run `pro version`. 
```

## Acquire your Ubuntu Pro token

Your Ubuntu Pro token can be found on your Ubuntu Pro dashboard. To access your
dashboard, you need an [Ubuntu One](https://login.ubuntu.com/) account. If you
purchased an Ubuntu Pro subscription and don't yet have an Ubuntu One account,
be sure to use the same email address you used to purchase your subscription.
If you haven't purchased an Ubuntu Pro subscription, don't worry! Everyone gets
a free token for personal use with their Ubuntu One account -- no purchase
necessary.

The Ubuntu One account functions as a Single Sign On (SSO), so after you log in
we can go straight to the Ubuntu Pro dashboard at
[ubuntu.com/pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro). Here, you should see a list of your
subscriptions (including the "free for personal use" subscription) in the
left-hand column.

Click on the subscription that you wish to use for this tutorial, if it is not
already selected. On the right you will now see the details of your
subscription, including your secret token (under the "Subscription" header and
next to the "ðŸ”—" symbol).

```{caution}
The Ubuntu Pro token must be kept secret. It is used to uniquely identify your
Ubuntu Pro subscription.
```

## Create an Ubuntu Pro Client attach config file

First, let's create a directory for this tutorial and navigate there.

```bash
mkdir pro_fips_tutorial
cd pro_fips_tutorial
```

Now we need to create our config file called `pro-attach-config.yaml`:

```bash
touch pro-attach-config.yaml
```

Edit the file, add the following contents, and save it:

```yaml
token: YOUR_TOKEN
enable_services:
  - fips
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the Ubuntu Pro token we got from
[ubuntu.com/pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro).

## Create a Dockerfile

Next, let us create a file named `Dockerfile` by running the following command:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

This file will later enable FIPS in the container, upgrade all the packages,
and install the FIPS version of `openssl`. 

Edit the file and add the following contents:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:focal

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=pro-attach-config \
    apt-get update \
    && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y ubuntu-advantage-tools ca-certificates \
    && pro attach --attach-config /run/secrets/pro-attach-config \
    && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && apt-get install -y openssl libssl1.1 libssl1.1-hmac libgcrypt20 libgcrypt20-hmac strongswan strongswan-hmac openssh-client openssh-server \
    && apt-get purge --auto-remove -y ubuntu-advantage-tools ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

```{seealso}

Pro Services in a Dockerfile](../howtoguides/enable_in_dockerfile.md)
```

## Build the Docker image

Now let's build the docker image by running the following command:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --secret id=pro-attach-config,src=pro-attach-config.yaml -t ubuntu-focal-fips
```

This will pass the `pro-attach-config.yaml` file we created earlier as a
[BuildKit Secret](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information)
so that the finished Docker image will not contain your Ubuntu Pro token.

## Test the Docker image

```{important}
The Docker image isn't considered fully FIPS compliant unless it is running on
a host Ubuntu machine that is also FIPS compliant.
```

Let's check to make sure the FIPS version of `openssl` is installed in the
container. First, let us run:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu-focal-fips dpkg-query --show openssl
```

This should show something like: `openssl	1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.fips.2.8` (notice
"fips" in the version name).

We can now use the build Docker image's FIPS compliant `openssl` to connect to
`https://ubuntu.com`:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu-focal-fips sh -c "echo | openssl s_client -connect ubuntu.com:443"
```

This should print information about the certificates of ubuntu.com and the
algorithms used during the TLS handshake.

## Success

That's it! You could now push this image to a private registry and use it as
the base of other Docker images using `FROM`.
