The Ubuntu Pro Client (``pro``) can be used to inspect and resolve
`Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures <cve_>`_ (CVEs) and
`Ubuntu Security Notices <usn_>`_ (USNs) on your machine.

Every CVE/USN is fixed by trying to upgrade all of the affected packages
described by the CVE or USN. Sometimes, the package fixes can only be applied
if an Ubuntu Pro service is already enabled on your machine.
