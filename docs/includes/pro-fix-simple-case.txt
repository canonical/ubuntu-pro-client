This is best demonstrated in a ``pro fix`` call that *does* fix a package.

Therefore let us install an older package on the VM that we know is associated
with `CVE-2020-25686`_. You can install the package by running these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install dnsmasq=2.75-1

Now, let's run ``pro fix`` on the CVE:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25686

You will then see the following output:

.. code-block:: text

    CVE-2020-25686: Dnsmasq vulnerabilities
     - https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25686

    1 affected package is installed: dnsmasq
    (1/1) dnsmasq:
    A fix is available in Ubuntu standard updates.
    { apt update && apt install --only-upgrade -y dnsmasq }

    ✔ CVE-2020-25686 is resolved.

.. note::

    We need to run the command with ``sudo`` because it will be installing a
    package on the system.

Whenever ``pro fix`` has a package to upgrade, it follows a consistent
structure and displays the following, in this order:

1. The affected package
2. The availability of a fix
3. The location of the fix, if one is available
4. The command that will fix the issue

Also, at the end of the output you can see confirmation that the CVE was fixed
by the command. Just to confirm that the fix was successfully applied, let's
run the ``pro fix`` command again, and we should now see the following:

.. code-block:: text

    CVE-2020-25686: Dnsmasq vulnerabilities
     - https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25686

    1 affected package is installed: dnsmasq
    (1/1) dnsmasq:
    A fix is available in Ubuntu standard updates.
    The update is already installed.

    ✔ CVE-2020-25686 is resolved.
