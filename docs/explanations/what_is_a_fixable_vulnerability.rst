What is a fixable vulnerability ?
*********************************

On any ``pro vulnerability``, we consider a vulnerability (CVE or USN) as **fixable**,
if and only if, at least **one** affected installed package associated with it can
be fixed. That means that a vulnerability is unfixable if no affected installed packages
related to the vulnerability can be fixed at the moment.
