Why 14.04 (Trusty) is no longer supported
*****************************************

On 14.04 (Trusty), the Ubuntu Pro Client package is not receiving upstream
updates beyond version 19.6, plus any critical CVE maintenance related to this
version.

Version 19.6 already has full-featured support of the applicable Ubuntu Pro
service offerings ``esm-infra`` and ``livepatch``. In the event that a CVE is
discovered that affects the Ubuntu Pro Client version on Trusty, a fix and
backport will be provided for those specific issues.
