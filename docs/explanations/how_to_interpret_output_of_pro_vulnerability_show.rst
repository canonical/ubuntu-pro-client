How to interpret the output of pro vulnerability show
*****************************************************

If you suspect that a CVE affects your system and wants to verify
if that is true, you can use the ``pro vulnerability show`` command for this.
This command will show you all the related information to a CVE **if** it affects
your system.

For example, let's assume that ``CVE-2022-2286`` affects your system and you run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pro vulnerability show CVE-2022-2286

You will see an output similar to this one:

.. code-block:: text

Let's break it down the output of this command. We start by telling you some basic information for
the CVE:

* **Public URL**: The ubuntu security page for this CVE
* **Published at**: The published date for the CVE
* **Ubunut vulnerability data published at**: The published for the vulnerability data we consume to
  generate this output
* **APT package information updated at**: The last time the APT state was updated in the system
  (i.e. running an apt install operation)
* **Ubuntu priority**: The ubuntu priority for this CVE
* **CVSS score**: The CVSS score of the CVE
* **CVESS severity**: The CVSS severity of the CVE

After that, we display the CVE description and related notes (if the CVE has notes).

The next block is now displaying which installed packages in the machine are affected by the CVE.
Whe are using table to display those affected packages where:

* **NAME**: The package name
* **STATUS**: The CVE status for this package
* **CURRENT VERSION**: The current installed version of the package
* **FIXED BY**: The version of that package that fix the CVE issue
* **FIX AVAILABLE FROM**: The pocket where the fix version can be found on

Finally, we also display the related USNs to the CVE, in case you want to take a look on them as
well.

What if the CVE doesn't affect my system ?
==========================================

If the CVE doesn't affect your system, running the ``pro vulnerability show`` will show
you the an output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    ● CVE-2024-7542
    Public URL: https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-7542
    Ubuntu vulnerability data published at: 2024-10-22 23:37:41
    APT package information updated at: 2024-10-23 19:37:11
    
    CVE-2024-7542 does not affect your system.

Note that we directly inform you that the CVE doesn't affect your system.

What if some packages cannot be fixed for a CVE?
================================================

When that happens, our affected installed packages table will inform you about that.
For example, here is the table output for the situation where some packages cannot be
fixed:

.. code-block:: text

    NAME                  STATUS      CURRENT VERSION          FIXED BY  FIX AVAILABLE FROM
    libpython3.5          vulnerable  3.5.2-2ubuntu0~16.04.13  -         no-fix
    libpython3.5-minimal  vulnerable  3.5.2-2ubuntu0~16.04.13  -         no-fix
    libpython3.5-stdlib   vulnerable  3.5.2-2ubuntu0~16.04.13  -         no-fix
    python3.5             vulnerable  3.5.2-2ubuntu0~16.04.13  -         no-fix
    python3.5-minimal     vulnerable  3.5.2-2ubuntu0~16.04.13  -         no-fix

Note that the package status show that it is **vulnerabable** and that the **FIXED BY** and
**FIX AVAILABLE FROM** column will tell you that no fix is available for the package.

What if I want to see a USN instead ?
=====================================

To see information about a USN, you just need to provide a USN name instead. For example,
to see information about USN-4976-2 you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pro vulnerability show USN-4976-2

Assuming you are affected by the USN, you might see an output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Public URL: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4976-2
    Published at: 2022-09-07 15:22:39
    Ubuntu vulnerability data published at: 2024-10-22 23:37:41
    APT package information updated at: 2024-10-23 19:37:11
    
    [DESCRIPTION]
    USN-4976-1 fixed a vulnerability in Dnsmasq. This update provides
    the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.
    
    Dnsmasq has been updated to 2.79-1 for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM in order to fix
    some security issues.
    
    Original advisory details:
    
     Petr Mensik discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly randomized source ports in
     certain configurations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
     facilitate DNS cache poisoning attacks.

Note that the information presented here is similar to the one display for the CVE.
However, we are not displaying information that is only tied to a CVE, such as
CVSS score and Ubuntu priority.

Finally, note that the last table is called Related CVEs instead, since we are now
showing the related CVEs for the given USN.
