# What is the ubuntu-advantage-pro package?

The ubuntu-advantage-pro package is used by [Public Cloud Ubuntu Pro](what_are_ubuntu_pro_cloud_instances.md) machines to automate machine attach on boot.
Therefore, the only thing that `ubuntu-advantage-pro` does is ship a systemd unit that runs an auto-attach command on first boot.
