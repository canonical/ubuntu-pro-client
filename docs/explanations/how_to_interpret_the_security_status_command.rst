What does ``security-status`` do?
*********************************

The ``security-status`` command provides an overview of all the packages
installed on your machine, and the security coverage that applies to those
packages.

The output of the ``security-status`` command varies, depending on the
configuration of the machine you run it on. In this article, we'll take a look
at the different outputs of ``security-status`` and the situations in which
you might see them.

Command output
==============

If you run the ``pro security-status`` command, the first blocks of information
you see look like:

.. code-block:: text

    2871 packages installed:
        2337 packages from Ubuntu Main/Restricted repository
        504 packages from Ubuntu Universe/Multiverse repository
        8 packages from third parties
        22 packages no longer available for download

    To get more information about the packages, run
        pro security-status --help
    for a list of available options.

Those are counts for the ``apt`` packages installed in the system, sorted
between the packages in main, universe, third party packages, and packages
that are no longer available. You will also see a hint to run
``pro security-status --help`` to get more information.

``apt update`` reminder
-----------------------

To get accurate package information, the ``apt`` caches must be up to date. If
your cache was not updated recently, you may see a message in the output with
a reminder to update.

.. code-block:: text

    The system apt cache may be outdated. Make sure to run
        sudo apt-get update
    to get the latest package information from apt.

LTS coverage
------------

If ``esm-infra`` is disabled in your system, main/restricted packages will be
covered during the LTS period - this information is presented right after the
hints. A covered system will present this message:

.. code-block:: text

    This machine is receiving security patching for Ubuntu Main/Restricted
    repository until <year>.

On a system where the LTS period ended, you'll see:

.. code-block:: text

    This machine is NOT receiving security patches because the LTS period has ended
    and esm-infra is not enabled.

Ubuntu Pro coverage
-------------------

An Ubuntu Pro subscription provides more security coverage than a standard LTS.
The next blocks of information are related to Ubuntu Pro itself:

.. code-block:: text

    This machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription.

    Main/Restricted packages are receiving security updates from
    Ubuntu Pro with 'esm-infra' enabled until 2032.

    Universe/Multiverse packages are receiving security updates from
    Ubuntu Pro with 'esm-apps' enabled until 2032. You have received 21 security
    updates.

This system is already attached to Pro! It is a Jammy machine, which has
installed some updates from ``esm-apps``. Running the same command on a Xenial
system without Pro enabled, the output looks like:

.. code-block:: text

    This machine is NOT attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription.

    Ubuntu Pro with 'esm-infra' enabled provides security updates for
    Main/Restricted packages until 2026. There are 170 pending security updates.

    Ubuntu Pro with 'esm-apps' enabled provides security updates for
    Universe/Multiverse packages until 2026. There is 1 pending security update.

    Try Ubuntu Pro with a free personal subscription on up to 5 machines.
    Learn more at https://ubuntu.com/pro

There are lots of ``esm-infra`` updates for this machine, and even an
``esm-apps`` update. The hint in the end of the output has a link to the main
Pro website, so the user can learn more about Pro and get their subscription.

Interim releases
----------------

If you are running an interim release, the output is slightly different because
there are no Ubuntu Pro services available. You will still see the package
counts and support period though - your main/restricted packages are supported
for 9 months from the release date.

.. code-block:: text

    613 packages installed:
        601 packages from Ubuntu Main/Restricted repository
        12 packages from Ubuntu Universe/Multiverse repository

    To get more information about the packages, run
        pro security-status --help
    for a list of available options.

    Main/Restricted packages receive updates until 1/2024.

    Ubuntu Pro is not available for non-LTS releases.

Optional flags for specific package sets
----------------------------------------

Some flags can be passed to ``security-status`` to get information about
coverage of specific package sets. As an example, let's look at the output of
``pro security-status --esm-infra``:

.. code-block:: text

    442 packages installed:
        441 packages from Ubuntu Main/Restricted repository

    Main/Restricted packages are receiving security updates from
    Ubuntu Pro with 'esm-infra' enabled until 2026. You have received 3 security
    updates. There are 160 pending security updates.

    Run 'pro help esm-infra' to learn more

    Installed packages with an available esm-infra update:
    ( ... list of packages ... )

    Installed packages with an esm-infra update applied:
    ( ... list of packages ... )

    Further installed packages covered by esm-infra:
    ( ... list of packages ... )

    For example, run:
        apt-cache show tcpdump
    to learn more about that package.

Besides the support information of main/restricted (which Ubuntu Pro with
``esm-infra`` extends) there are lists of:

- Packages with an updated version available in ESM-infra repositories
- Packages with a version installed from the ESM-infra repositories
- Packages which are covered by ESM-infra

You will see a similar output when running ``pro security-status --esm-apps``,
but with information regarding universe/multiverse packages.

You can also get a list of the third-party packages installed in the system:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pro security-status --thirdparty
    2871 packages installed:
        8 packages from third parties

    Packages from third parties are not provided by the official Ubuntu
    archive, for example packages from Personal Package Archives in Launchpad.

    Packages:
    ( ... list of packages ... )

    For example, run:
        apt-cache show <package_name>
    to learn more about that package.

And also a list of unavailable packages (which no longer have any installation
source):

.. code-block:: text

    $ pro security-status --unavailable
    2871 packages installed:
        22 packages no longer available for download

    Packages that are not available for download may be left over from a
    previous release of Ubuntu, may have been installed directly from a
    .deb file, or are from a source which has been disabled.

    Packages:
    ( ... list of packages ... )


    For example, run:
        apt-cache show <package_name>
    to learn more about that package.

Machine-readable output
=======================

If you run the ``pro security-status --format yaml`` command on your machine,
you should expect to see an output that follows this structure:

.. code-block:: text

    _schema_version: '0.1'
    summary:
      num_esm_apps_packages: 0
      num_esm_apps_updates: 0

Let's understand what each key means in the output of the
``pro security-status --format yaml`` command:

``summary``
-----------

This provides a summary of the system related to Ubuntu Pro and the different
package sources in the system:

* **num_installed_packages**: The total number of installed packages on the
  system.
* **num_esm_apps_packages**: The number of packages installed from
  ``esm-apps``.
* **num_esm_apps_updates**: The number of ``esm-apps`` package updates
  available to the system.
* **num_esm_infra_packages**: The number of packages installed from
  ``esm-infra``.
* **num_esm_infra_updates**: The number of ``esm-infra`` package updates
  available to the system.
* **num_main_packages**: The number of packages installed from the ``main``
  archive component.
* **num_multiverse_packages**: The number of packages installed from the
  ``multiverse`` archive component.
* **num_restricted_packages**: The number of packages installed from the
  ``restricted`` archive component.
* **num_third_party_packages** : The number of packages installed from
  ``third party`` sources.
* **num_universe_packages**: The number of packages installed from the
  ``universe`` archive component.
* **num_unknown_packages**: The number of packages installed from sources not
  known to ``apt`` (e.g., those installed locally through ``dpkg`` or packages
  without a remote reference).
* **num_standard_security_updates**: The number of standard security updates
  available to the system.

.. note::

    It is worth mentioning here that the ``_updates`` fields are presenting the
    number of **security** updates for **installed** packages. For example,
    let's assume your machine has a universe package that has a security update
    from ``esm-infra``. The count will be displayed as:

    .. code-block:: text

        num_esm_infra_packages: 0
        num_esm_infra_updates: 1
        num_universe_packages: 1
    
    After upgrading the system, the count will turn to:

    .. code-block:: text

        num_esm_infra_packages: 1
        num_esm_infra_updates: 0
        num_universe_packages: 0
    
* **ua**: An object representing the state of Ubuntu Pro on the system:

  * **attached**: If the system is attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription.
  * **enabled_services**: A list of services that are enabled on the system.
    If unattached, this will always be an empty list.
  * **entitled_services**: A list of services that are entitled on your
    Ubuntu Pro subscription. If unattached, this will always be an empty list.

``packages``
------------

This provides a list of security updates for packages installed on the system.
Every entry on the list will follow this structure:

* **origin**: The host where the update comes from.
* **package**: The name of the package.
* **service_name**: The service that provides the package update. It can be
  one of: ``esm-infra``, ``esm-apps`` or ``standard-security``.
* **status**: The status for this update. It will be one of:

  * **"upgrade_available"**: The package can be upgraded right now.
  * **"pending_attach"**: The package needs an Ubuntu Pro subscription attached
    to be upgraded.
  * **"pending_enable"**: The machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro subscription,
    but the service required to provide the upgrade is not enabled.
  * **"upgrade_unavailable"**: The machine is attached, but the contract is not
    entitled to the service which provides the upgrade.

* **version**: The update version.
* **download_size**: The number of bytes that would be downloaded in order to
  install the update.

``livepatch``
-------------

This displays Livepatch-related information. Currently, the only information
presented is **`fixed_cves`**. This represents a list of CVEs that were fixed
by Livepatches applied to the kernel.
