CVEs and USNs explained
***********************

What is a CVE
=============

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are a way to catalogue and track
public security vulnerabilities for a given software. Every CVE is identified
through a unique identifier, for example `CVE-2023-0465`_.

CVEs are maintained by the `MITRE Corporation`_ and the goal of the project is
to provide naming conventions for the public known security issues while also
maintaining a centralised repository for all of the security issues. This makes
it easier for an organisation to submit a new security flaw though the CVE
convention while also analysing any other existing CVEs in the database.

You can search for any existing CVE related to Ubuntu using
`the Ubuntu CVE page <cve_>`_.

What is a USN?
==============

An Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) is the way that Canonical publicly catalogues
and displays security vulnerabilities for Ubuntu packages. Usually, a USN is
composed of one or more [CVEs](#what-is-a-cve) and it also contains update
instructions to fix the issue, if a fix is already available.

USNs follow a naming convention of the format `USN-5963-1`_.

You can search for any existing USN using
`the Ubuntu Security Notices page <usn_>`_.

What are related USNs?
======================

A USN is composed of different CVEs. If the same CVE appears on multiple USNs,
we say that those USNs are related.

In the following image, we can see a visual representation of that concept,
where USN-789 and USN-321 are related USNs because both are affected by CVE-2:

.. mermaid::

    graph TD;
        %% nodes
        usn1[USN-123]
        usn2[USN-456]
        usn3[USN-789]
        usn4[USN-321]
        usn5[USN-654]
        cve1((CVE-1))
        cve2((CVE-2))
        cve3((CVE-3))

        %% arrows
        usn1-->cve1
        usn1-->cve2
        usn1-->cve3
        cve1-->usn2
        cve2-->usn3
        cve2-->usn4
        cve3-->usn5


A real example can be seen in `USN-5573-1`_. In the section **Related
notices**, it shows that both **USN-5570-1** and **USN-5570-2** are related to
**USN-5573-1**.

This information is useful for users that want to tackle all related USNs at
once, making sure that a CVE is fully fixed on their Ubuntu machine.
