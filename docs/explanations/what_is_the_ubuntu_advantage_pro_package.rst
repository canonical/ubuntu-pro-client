What is the ``ubuntu-advantage-pro`` package?
*********************************************

The ``ubuntu-advantage-pro`` package is used by
:ref:`Public Cloud Ubuntu Pro <expl-about-pro-cpc>` machines to automate the
process of attaching a machine on boot.

Therefore, the only thing that ``ubuntu-advantage-pro`` does is ship a
``systemd`` unit that runs an auto-attach command on first boot.
