What is the ``ubuntu-pro-auto-attach`` package?
************************************************

The ``ubuntu-pro-auto-attach`` package is used by
:ref:`Public Cloud Ubuntu Pro <expl-about-pro-cpc>` machines to automate the
process of attaching a machine on boot.

Therefore, the only thing that ``ubuntu-pro-auto-attach`` does is ship a
``systemd`` unit that runs an auto-attach command on first boot.
