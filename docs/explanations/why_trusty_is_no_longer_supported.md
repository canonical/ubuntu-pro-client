# Why trusty is no longer supported

On 14.04 (Trusty), the Ubuntu Pro Client package is not receiving upstream updates
beyond version 19.6 plus any critical CVE maintenance related to this version. Version 19.6 already
has full-featured support of the applicable Ubuntu Pro service offerings `esm-infra` and `livepatch`. In the
event that a CVE is discovered that affects the Ubuntu Pro Client version on Trusty, a fix and backport will be
provided for those specific issues.
