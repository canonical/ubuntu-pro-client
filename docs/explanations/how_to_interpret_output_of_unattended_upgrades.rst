How to interpret the output of unattended-upgrades
**************************************************

In Pro Client version 27.14~, we introduced the
``u.pro.unattended_upgrades.status.v1`` endpoint. This endpoint is designed to
provide users with an overview of the configuration and setup for
unattended upgrades on the machine. The expected output follows this JSON
example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "_schema_version": "v1",
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "apt_periodic_job_enabled": true,
          "package_lists_refresh_frequency_days": 1,
          "systemd_apt_timer_enabled": true,
          "unattended_upgrades_allowed_origins": [
            "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}",
            "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security",
            "${distro_id}ESMApps:${distro_codename}-apps-security",
            "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}-infra-security"
          ],
          "unattended_upgrades_disabled_reason": null,
          "unattended_upgrades_frequency_days": 1,
          "unattended_upgrades_last_run": null,
          "unattended_upgrades_running": true
        },
        "meta": {
          "environment_vars": [],
          "raw_config": {
            "APT::Periodic::Enable": "1",
            "APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade": "1",
            "APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists": "1",
            "Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins": [
              "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}",
              "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security",
              "${distro_id}ESMApps:${distro_codename}-apps-security",
              "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}-infra-security"
            ]
          }
        },
        "type": "UnattendedUpgradesStatus"
      },
      "errors": [],
      "result": "success",
      "version": "27.14~16.04.1",
      "warnings": []
    }

As we can see from this output, there is a variable named
``unattended_upgrades_running``. That variable indicates whether
``unattended-upgrades`` is properly configured and running on the machine.
The value of this field will only be ``true`` if **ALL**  of the following
prerequisites are also true:

* ``apt_periodic_job_enable`` is "true":
  
  This variable indicates whether the ``APT::Periodic::Enable`` configuration
  variable is turned on. If it is turned off, ``unattended-upgrades`` will not
  automatically run on the machine.

* ``package_lists_refresh_frequency_days`` is non-zero:
  
  This variable shows the value of ``APT::Periodic::Package-List-Frequency``.
  This defines the daily frequency for updating package sources in the
  background. If it has a zero value, this step will never happen and
  ``unattended-upgrades`` might not be able to install new versions of the
  packages.

* ``systemd_apt_timer_enabled`` is "true":
  
  This variable is true if both ``apt-daily.timer`` and
  ``apt-daily-upgrade.timer`` are running on the machine. These timers are the
  ones that control when ``unattended-upgrades`` runs. The first job,
  ``apt-daily.timer`` is responsible for triggering the code that downloads the
  latest package information on the system. The second job,
  ``apt-daily-upgrade.timer`` is responsible for running
  ``unattended-upgrades`` to download the latest version of the packages. If
  one of these jobs is disabled, ``unattended-upgrades`` might not work as
  expected.

* ``unattended_upgrades_allowed_origins`` is not empty:
  
  This variable defines the origins that ``unattended-upgrades`` can use to
  install a package. If that list is empty, no packages can be installed and
  ``unattended-upgrades`` will not work as expected.

* ``unattended_upgrades_frequency_days`` is non-zero:
  
  That variable shows the value of ``APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade``. This
  configuration defines the daily frequency for running ``unattended-upgrades``
  in the background. Therefore, if it has a zero value, the command will never
  run.

If *any* of these conditions are not met, the variable
``unattended_upgrades_disabled_reason`` will contain an object explaining why
``unattended-upgrades`` is not running. For example, if
``package_lists_refresh_frequency_days`` has a zero value, we will see
the following value for ``unattended_upgrades_disabled_reason``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "msg": "APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists is turned off",
        "code": "unattended-upgrades-cfg-value-turned-off"
    }
