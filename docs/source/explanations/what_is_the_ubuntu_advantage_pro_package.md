# What is the ubuntu-advantage-pro package?

The ubuntu-advantage-pro package is used by [Ubuntu PRO](what_is_ubuntu_pro.md) machine to automate machine attach on boot.
Therefore, the only main difference between the ubuntu-advantage-pro and ubuntu-advantage-tools
package is that the pro package ships a systemd unit that runs the auto-attach command on first
boot.
