# How to configure a timer job

All timer jobs can be configured through the `ua config set` command.
We will show how we can properly use that command to interact with those jobs.


## How to check timer jobs configuration

To see each jobâ€™s running interval, use the show command:

```console
$ sudo ua config show
```

You should see output which include the timer jobs:

```
update_messaging_timer  21600
update_status_timer     43200
metering_timer          14400
```


## Changing a timer job interval

Each job has a configuration option of the form `<job_name>_timer`,
which can be set with `ua config`.  The expected value is a positive
integer for the number of seconds in the interval. For example, to
change the `update_status job` timer interval to run every 24 hours, run:

```console
$ sudo ua config set update_status_timer=86400
```


## How to disable a timer job

To disable a job, set its interval to zero. For instance, to disable
the `update_messaging`  job, run:

```console
$ sudo ua config set update_messaging_timer=0
```
