Ubuntu Pro Client reference
***************************

Our reference section contains technical information for the Ubuntu Pro Client.

Interacting with the Client
===========================

There are two main ways to interact with the Pro Client: on the command line
interface (CLI) in your terminal, or automatically via the API.

* :ref:`CLI reference guide <commands>`
* :ref:`API reference guide <api>`

You may, in a staging or canary environment, also wish to test upcoming
changes. For this, you can use the available Personal Package Archives (PPA)
for the Ubuntu Pro Client.

* :ref:`Personal Package Archives (PPAs) <PPAs>`

You may occasionally encounter an error message when interacting with the
Pro Client. If you do, check this page to find more details about the error.

* :ref:`Error messages <error-messages>`

Support and requirements
========================

The Pro Client comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu LTS systems and is used to
manage additional Ubuntu Pro services and offerings. However, some services
cannot be enabled at the same time.

In this section, you can check if your chosen release is supported, and whether
the services you want to use are compatible with each other.
