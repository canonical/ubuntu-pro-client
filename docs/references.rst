You may, in a production environment, also wish to test upcoming changes. For
this, you can use the available Personal Package Archives (PPA) for the Ubuntu
Pro Client.

You may occasionally encounter an error message when interacting with the

Support and compatibility
=========================

The Pro Client comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu LTS systems and is used to
manage additional Ubuntu Pro services and offerings. However, some services
cannot be enabled at the same time.

In this section, you can check if your chosen release is supported, and whether
the services you want to use are compatible with each other.
