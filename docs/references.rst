Reference
*********

Our reference section contains technical information for the Ubuntu Pro Client.

Interacting with the Client
===========================

There are two main ways to interact with the Pro Client: on the command line
interface (CLI) in your terminal, or automatically via the API.

* :ref:`CLI reference guide <commands>`
* :ref:`API reference guide <api>`
* :ref:`Error messages <error-messages>`

You may, in a staging or canary environment, want to test upcoming changes.
For this, you can use the available Pro Client Personal Package Archives (PPA).

* :ref:`Personal Package Archives (PPAs) <PPAs>`

Support and requirements
========================

Some Ubuntu Pro services cannot be enabled at the same time. In this section,
you can check if your chosen release is supported, and whether the services you
want to use are compatible with each other.

* :ref:`Supported Ubuntu releases <support_matrix>`
* :ref:`Compatible Ubuntu Pro services <compatibility_matrix>`
* :ref:`Network requirements <network_requirements>`
