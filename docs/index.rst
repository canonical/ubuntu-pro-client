Ubuntu Pro Client
=================

The Ubuntu Pro Client (``pro``) is the offical tool to enable Canonical offerings on your
system.

``pro`` provides support to view, enable, and disable the following Canonical services:

- `Common Criteria EAL2 Certification Tooling`_
- `CIS Benchmark Audit Tooling`_
- `Ubuntu Security Guide (USG) Tooling`_
- `Ubuntu Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)`_
- `Robot Operating System (ROS) Expanded Security Maintenance`_
- `FIPS 140-2 Certified Modules (and optional non-certified patches)`_
- `Livepatch`_

If you need any of those services for your machine, ``pro`` is the right tool for you.

``pro`` is already installed on every Ubuntu system. Try it out by running ``pro help``!
