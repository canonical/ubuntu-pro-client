UA provides support to view, enable, and disable the following Canonical services:

- `Common Criteria EAL2 Certification Tooling <https://ubuntu.com/security/cc>`_
- `CIS Benchmark Audit Tooling <https://ubuntu.com/security/cis>`_
- `Ubuntu Security Guide (USG) Tooling <https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/usg>`_
- `Ubuntu Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) <https://ubuntu.com/security/esm>`_
- `Robot Operating System (ROS) Expanded Security Maintenance <https://ubuntu.com/robotics/ros-esm>`_
- `FIPS 140-2 Certified Modules (and optional non-certified patches <https://ubuntu.com/security/fips>`_

If you need any of those services for your machine, UA is the right tool for you.
Furthermore, UA is already installed on every Ubuntu system. Try it out by running ``ua help``!
