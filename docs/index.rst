Ubuntu Pro Client
=================

The Ubuntu Pro Client (``pro``) is the offical tool to enable Canonical offerings on your
system.

``pro`` provides support to view, enable, and disable the following Canonical services:

- `Common Criteria EAL2 Certification Tooling`_
- `CIS Benchmark Audit Tooling`_
- `Ubuntu Security Guide (USG) Tooling`_
- `Ubuntu Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)`_
