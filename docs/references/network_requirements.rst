Ubuntu Pro Client network requirements
**************************************

The Ubuntu Pro Client (``pro``) and Ubuntu Pro services need to make network
requests to certain services to function correctly.

.. note::

    You can also refer to our
    :ref:`proxy configuration guide <configure-proxies>` to learn how to
    inform Ubuntu Pro Client of HTTP(S)/APT proxies.

Authentication
==============

``pro`` needs to authenticate with Canonical servers to provision the
credentials that will grant access to the individual Ubuntu Pro services.

Necessary endpoints:

- ``contracts.canonical.com:443``

APT package-based services
==========================

Many services are delivered via authenticated APT repositories. These include:

- ``esm-infra`` and ``esm-apps``
- ``fips`` and ``fips-updates``
- ``cis`` and ``usg``
- ``cc-eal``
- ``ros`` and ``ros-updates``
- ``realtime-kernel``

Necessary endpoints:

- ``esm.ubuntu.com:443``

Livepatch
=========

``livepatch`` requires a snap-packaged client, so snap-related endpoints are
necessary. The Livepatch client itself also requires network access to download
the patches from the Livepatch server.

.. note::

    The `snap documentation page`_ may have more up-to-date information on
    snap-related network requirements.

Necessary endpoints for ``snap``

- ``api.snapcraft.io:443``
- ``dashboard.snapcraft.io:443``
- ``login.ubuntu.com:443``
- ``*.snapcraftcontent.com:443``

Necessary endpoints for ``livepatch``:

- ``livepatch.canonical.com:443``

Fix
===

``pro fix`` needs to fetch information about USNs and/or CVEs from the Ubuntu
Security APIs.

Necessary endpoints:

- ``ubuntu.com/security:443``
