Support matrix for the Ubuntu Pro Client
****************************************

Ubuntu Pro services are only available on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)
releases.

On interim Ubuntu releases, ``pro status`` will report most of the services as
"n/a" (not applicable), and disallow enabling those services.

Here is a list of platforms and releases that Ubuntu Pro Client supports,
through the ``ubuntu-pro-client`` package (``ubuntu-advantage-tools`` on
Trusty).

It is available on amd64, arm64, armhf and ppc64el architectures on **all**
releases.
