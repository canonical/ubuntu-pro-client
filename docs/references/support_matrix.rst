Support matrix for the Ubuntu Pro Client
****************************************

Ubuntu Pro services are only available on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)
releases.

On interim Ubuntu releases, ``pro status`` will report most of the services as
"n/a" (not applicable), and disallow enabling those services.

Here is a list of platforms and releases that Ubuntu Pro Client, through the
``ubuntu-advantage-tools`` package, supports.
