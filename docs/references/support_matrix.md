# Support matrix for the Ubuntu Pro Client

Ubuntu Pro services are only available on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)
releases.

On interim Ubuntu releases, `pro status` will report most of the services as
"n/a" (not applicable), and disallow enabling those services.

Here is a list of platforms and releases that `ubuntu-advantage-tools` supports.
