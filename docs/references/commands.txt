pro attach
==========

**Usage:**

``pro attach [-h] [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config ATTACH_CONFIG] [--format {cli,json}] [token]``

**Description:**

Attach this machine to an Ubuntu Pro subscription with a token obtained from:
https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard

When running this command without a token, it will generate a short code
and prompt you to attach the machine to your Ubuntu Pro account using
a web browser.

The "attach-config" option can be used to provide a file with the token
and optionally, a list of services to enable after attaching. To know more,
visit:
https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howtoguides/how_to_attach_with_config_file/

The exit code will be:

    * 0: on successful attach
    * 1: in case of any error while trying to attach
    * 2: if the machine is already attached

pro status
==========

**Usage:**

``pro status [-h] [--wait] [--format {tabular,json,yaml}] [--simulate-with-token TOKEN] [--all]``

**Description:**

Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro
support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific
support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

    * SERVICE: Name of the service.
    * ENTITLED: Whether the contract to which this machine is attached
      entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no.
    * STATUS: Whether the service is enabled on this machine. Possible
      values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles
      you to the service, but it isn't available for this machine) or - (if
      you aren't entitled to this service).
    * DESCRIPTION: A brief description of the service.

The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE
and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

    * AVAILABLE: Whether this service would be available if this machine
      were attached. The possible values are yes or no.

If "simulate-with-token" is used, then the output has five
columns. SERVICE, AVAILABLE, ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the same
as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the service is set
to be enabled when that token is attached.

If the "all" flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also
listed in the output.


pro system
==========

**Usage:**

``pro system [-h] {reboot-required} ...``

**Description:**

Output system-related information about Pro services.

pro system reboot-required
--------------------------

**Usage:**

``pro system reboot-required [-h]``

**Description:**

Report the current reboot-required status for the machine.

This command will output one of the three following states
for the machine regarding reboot:

    * no: The machine doesn't require a reboot.
    * yes: The machine requires a reboot.
    * yes-kernel-livepatches-applied: There are only kernel-related
      packages that require a reboot, but Livepatch has already provided
      patches for the current running kernel. The machine still needs a
      reboot, but you can assess if the reboot can be performed in the
      nearest maintenance window.
