The Ubuntu Pro Client (`pro`) is the official tool to enable Canonical offerings on your
system.

`pro` provides support to view, enable, and disable the following Canonical services:

- [Common Criteria EAL2 Certification Tooling](https://ubuntu.com/security/cc)
- [CIS Benchmark Audit Tooling](https://ubuntu.com/security/cis)
- [Ubuntu Security Guide (USG) Tooling](https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/usg)
- [Ubuntu Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)](https://ubuntu.com/security/esm)
- [Robot Operating System (ROS) Expanded Security Maintenance](https://ubuntu.com/robotics/ros-esm)
- [FIPS 140-2 Certified Modules (and optional non-certified patches)](https://ubuntu.com/security/fips)
- [Livepatch Service](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch)


If you need any of those services for your machine, `pro` is the right tool for you.

`pro` is already installed on every Ubuntu system. Try it out by running `pro help`!
