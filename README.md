  Ubuntu Pro Client Documentation
</h1>

The Ubuntu Pro Client (`pro`) is the official tool to enable Canonical
offerings on your system.

This branch (`docs`) contains the files used to build our documentation,
which is hosted at [Read the Docs](https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/).

For details of how you can contribute, including instructions on how to build
a local copy of the documentation, you can read
[our contributing guide](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-pro-client/blob/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
