# Get started developing for Ubuntu Pro Client

This tutorial will walk you through getting your development environment set up from scratch for contributing to Ubuntu Pro Client.

We generally support the latest interim release and the latest LTS of Ubuntu as development hosts for Ubuntu Pro Client.

> **Note**
> This tutorial was last tested on Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic Minotaur (mantic).

# From nothing to unit tests

Open a terminal.

Install necessary host tooling.
```bash
sudo apt install git tox pre-commit intltool libapt-pkg-dev sbuild-launchpad-chroot
```
> **Note**
> Python comes installed by default on Ubuntu.
> Do not install Python via any non-Ubuntu means. That includes `conda`, `pyenv`, `asdf`, `ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`, download from python.org, etc.

Get the code.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-pro-client.git
cd ubuntu-pro-client
```

Initialize `pre-commit`.
```bash
pre-commit install
```
`pre-commit` will run `black`, `isort`, and `shellcheck` on any files you edit in a commit. If it makes any changes or finds problems, it will abort the commit. You can then `git add` the changes it made, or fix the issues, and then `git commit` again.

Run the unit tests and other checks.
```bash
tox
```
`tox` manages separate virtual environments for each of the different jobs we run. It will install all of the dependencies for each job into the virtual environment for that job, and then run the job. This ensures that the dependencies for each job don't interfere with each other.

> **Note**
> You can run individual jobs (or "environments" in tox terminology) with the `-e` flag.
>
> For example:
> - `tox -e test` will run the unit tests.
> - `tox -e flake8` will run the Python linter.
> - `tox -e mypy` will run the type checker.
> - `tox -e shellcheck` will run the bash script linter.
> - `tox -e behave` will run the integration tests (discussed more later).
>
> Explore `tox.ini` to see what tox environments are available and how they're configured.

# Getting to basic behave tests
We use [`behave`](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a framework for writing integration/acceptance/regression tests. Behave tests are in the `features/` folder and generally follow the pattern of:
1. Launch a VM or container on a platform (LXD, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
2. Install the version of Ubuntu Pro Client we want to test
3. Run commands on the system to exercise some feature of Pro Client
4. Assert that the expected results occurred

The most common behave tests use LXD as the platform. So we need the host to support launching LXD containers and VMs.

## Setting up LXD
Install `lxd`.
```bash
sudo snap install lxd
```
Add yourself to the `lxd` group and use `newgrp` to apply the change without logging out and back in.
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER
newgrp lxd
```
Initialise `lxd` - use the defaults.
```bash
lxd init
```

Ubuntu Pro Client is unique in that it supports very old releases of Ubuntu, including 16.04 Xenial Xerus (Xenial). We test this support by using Xenial LXD containers. In order for hosts running newer releases of Ubuntu to run Xenial containers, we need to configure systemd to use an older cgroup version for compatibility. This is configured by editing the Linux kernel boot parameters.

We need the boot parameter `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0`.

> **Note**
> Unfortunately, this means your host will miss out on the benefits and safety features of cgroup v2, but it is necessary to develop and support Ubuntu Pro Client for Xenial.

Use [this how-to guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters) to edit your Linux kernel boot parameter. First make the change temporarily, and ensure your system still boots and works. Then make the change permanently.

Now, with the boot parameter in place, test that a xenial container can start and reach the network.
```bash
lxc launch ubuntu-daily:xenial testx
lxc shell testx
# now you should be inside the container
ping -c 3 ubuntu.com
# the ping command should succeed
exit
# now you should be back on your host
lxc delete --force testx
```

> **Note**
> Docker can interfere with LXD container networking. If you need Docker installed alongside LXD, follow the guidance in [the LXD documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/howto/network_bridge_firewalld/#prevent-connectivity-issues-with-lxd-and-docker) to ensure that Docker doesn't break LXD networking.

## Building Ubuntu Pro Client for testing

To install a local version of Ubuntu Pro Client in a LXD container, we need to build a `deb` package. We have a script that will set up the environment necessary to build debs for any target Ubuntu release.

At time of writing, Ubuntu Pro Client supports the Ubuntu releases in this example command. You may need to adjust the command in the future as Ubuntu releases come and go.

This command also assumes you are on an `amd64` system. You will have to adjust the command accordingly if you are not.

```bash
env RELEASES="xenial bionic focal jammy mantic noble" ARCHS="amd64" bash tools/setup_sbuild.sh
```

This command will take some time. It sets up schroots for each release with the dependencies of Ubuntu Pro Client pre-installed. This will make building the deb packages for each release go faster. As time goes by, Ubuntu releases get updates which need to be installed for each build; you can re-run the `setup_sbuild.sh` script and it will update the schroots to keep your Pro Client builds fast.

You will also need to run the following to ensure your user can use the schroots.
```bash
sudo sbuild-adduser $USER
newgrp sbuild
```

After that is complete, try out a Xenial build.
```bash
./tools/build.sh xenial
```

## Configuring pycloudlib

We use [`pycloudlib`](https://github.com/canonical/pycloudlib) to manage instances on clouds for our behave tests, and local LXD containers are treated as a "cloud" by pycloudlib.

To get started, we just need a basic configuration of pycloudlib. Copy the contents of `pycloudlib.toml.template` from the source repository and save it to `~/.config/pycloudlib.toml` on your machine.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/pycloudlib/main/pycloudlib.toml.template -O ~/.config/pycloudlib.toml
```

## Run a simple behave test

```bash
tox -e behave -- features/config.feature -D releases=xenial -D machine_types=lxd-container
```

All of the arguments after the `--` are passed to behave. In this case, we're telling behave to only run the `config.feature` test, and to filter the tests in that file to only those for Xenial LXD containers. Note that the `-D` options are specific to our behave tests and are not behave options.

## Configuring a contract token

Now that you have `behave` working, ask a member of the Ubuntu Pro Client team for the testing contract tokens. There are three of them. You will need to set them as values of environment variables in your shell.

```bash
export UACLIENT_BEHAVE_CONTRACT_TOKEN=contract_token
export UACLIENT_BEHAVE_CONTRACT_TOKEN_STAGING=contract_token_staging
export UACLIENT_BEHAVE_CONTRACT_TOKEN_STAGING_EXPIRED=contract_token_staging_expired
```

Now you can run tests that use `pro` to attach to an Ubuntu Pro contract.

```bash
tox -e behave -- -n "snapd installed as a snap if necessary"
```

Notice that we're using the `-n` option to behave to filter the tests to only the one that matches the given string. This particular test happens to also be a test that uses a LXD VM, so it is a good test to run to ensure that your LXD VMs are working.

# Interacting with local changes
With all of the above in place, you can now make changes to the code and run a local version of Ubuntu Pro Client in a LXD container or Multipass VM to try out your changes.

Edit `uaclient/version.py` and modify the `get_version()` function to return a fake version string. For example, change the first line of the function to `return "42:42"`.

## Try it out in a container

Now use our helper script to build a deb with your changes, launch a LXD container, install your deb, and drop you into a shell on the container.
```bash
./tools/test-in-lxd.sh xenial
```
In the container, you can now run `pro version` and see your changes in action.

When you're done with the container, `exit` and remember to delete the container. The name of the container contains a unique hash of the version of `pro` you built; you can find it as the hostname of the container in the prompt of your shell, or by running `lxc list` on your host machine.

## Try it out in a VM

While we use LXD VMs for behave tests, it is difficult to set up Xenial and Bionic VMs manually for interactive testing. Instead, we use [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) to launch VMs for interactive testing.

Install Multipass.
```bash
sudo snap install multipass
```

Now use our helper script to build a deb with your changes, launch a Multipass VM, install your deb, and drop you into a shell on the VM.
```bash
./tools/test-in-multipass.sh xenial
```
In the VM, you can now run `pro version` and see your changes in action.

When you're done with the VM, `exit` and remember to delete the VM. The name of the VM contains a unique hash of the version of `pro` you built; you can find it as the hostname of the VM in the prompt of your shell, or by running `multipass list` on your host machine.
