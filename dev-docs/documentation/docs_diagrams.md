# How to add a diagram to the documentation

Our documentation builds are configured to allow the use of [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagramming, using the [sphinxcontrib-mermaid](https://github.com/mgaitan/sphinxcontrib-mermaid) plugin.

These links may be helpful to get started creating a new diagram in our documentation:
