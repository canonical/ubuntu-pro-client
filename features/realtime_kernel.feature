        Help:
        The Real-time kernel is an Ubuntu kernel with PREEMPT_RT patches integrated.
        It services latency-dependent use cases by providing deterministic response times.
        The Real-time kernel meets stringent preemption specifications and is suitable for
        telco applications and dedicated devices in industrial automation and robotics.
        The Real-time kernel is currently incompatible with FIPS and Livepatch. 

        Variants:

          * generic: Generic version of the RT kernel (default)
          * nvidia-tegra: RT kernel optimized for NVidia Tegra platforms
