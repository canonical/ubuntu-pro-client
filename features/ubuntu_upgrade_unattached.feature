    Scenario Outline: Unattached upgrade across LTS releases
        Given a `<release>` machine with ubuntu-advantage-tools installed
        When I run `apt-get dist-upgrade --assume-yes` with sudo
        And I create the file `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.d/ua-test.cfg` with the following
        """
        [Sources]
        AllowThirdParty=yes
        """
        And I run `sed -i 's/Prompt=lts/Prompt=normal/' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` with sudo
        And I run `do-release-upgrade <devel_release> --frontend DistUpgradeViewNonInteractive` `with sudo` and stdin `y\n`
        And I reboot the `<release>` machine
        And I run `lsb_release -cs` as non-root
        Then I will see the following on stdout:
        """
        <next_release>
        """
        And I verify that running `egrep "<release>|disabled" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*` `as non-root` exits `2`
        And I will see the following on stdout:
        """
        """
        When I run `ua status` with sudo
        Then stdout matches regexp:
