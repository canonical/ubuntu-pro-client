      Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

      This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Advantage
      support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific
      support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
      status of each service on this system.

      The attached status output has four columns:

      * SERVICE: name of the service
      * ENTITLED: whether the contract to which this machine is attached
        entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no
      * STATUS: whether the service is enabled on this machine. Possible
        values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles
        you to the service, but it isn't available for this machine) or — (if
        you aren't entitled to this service)
      * DESCRIPTION: a brief description of the service

      The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE
      and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition
      of:

      * AVAILABLE: whether this service would be available if this machine
        were attached. The possible values are yes or no.

      If --simulate-with-token is used, then the output has five
      columns. SERVICE, AVAILABLE, ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the same
      as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the service is set
      to be enabled when that token is attached.

      If the --all flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also
      listed in the output.

      * yes: The machine requires a reboot
