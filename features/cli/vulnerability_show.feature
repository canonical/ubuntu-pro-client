Feature: CLI vulnerability show command

  Scenario Outline: CLI vulnerability show
    Given a `<release>` `<machine_type>` machine with ubuntu-advantage-tools installed
    When I verify that running `pro vulnerability show invalid` `as non-root` exits `1`
    Then I will see the following on stderr:
      """
      Error: issue "invalid" is not recognized.
      Usage: "pro vulnerability show CVE-yyyy-nnnn" or "pro vulnerability show USN-nnnn"
      """
    When I push static file `security_issues_xenial.json` to machine
    And I run `pro vulnerability show CVE-2024-7542 --data-file=/tmp/security_issues_xenial.json` as non-root
    Then stdout matches regexp:

      CVE-2024-8088
      Public URL: https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-8088

      Ubuntu vulnerability data published at: .*
      APT package information updated at: .*
      Ubuntu priority: medium
      CVSS score: None
      CVSS severity: None

      \[DESCRIPTION\]
      There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile"
      module affecting "zipfile.Path". Note that the more common API
      "zipfile.ZipFile" class is unaffected.
      When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive \(for example, methods
      of "zipfile.Path" like "namelist\(\)", "iterdir\(\)", etc\)
      the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted
      zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting
      the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling
      user-controlled zip archives are not affected.
