Feature: CLI vulnerability show command

  Scenario Outline: CLI vulnerability show
    Given a `<release>` `<machine_type>` machine with ubuntu-advantage-tools installed
    When I verify that running `pro vulnerability show invalid` `as non-root` exits `1`
    Then I will see the following on stderr:
      """
      Error: issue "invalid" is not recognized.
      Usage: "pro vulnerability show CVE-yyyy-nnnn" or "pro vulnerability show USN-nnnn"
      """
    When I push static file `security_issues_xenial` to machine
    And I run `pro vulnerability show CVE-2024-7542 --data-file=/tmp/security_issues_xenial` as non-root
    Then I will see the following on stdout:
      """
      CVE-2024-7542 does not affect your system
      """
    When I run `apt update` with sudo
    And I run `apt install vim=2:7.4.1689-3ubuntu1.5 -y` with sudo
    And I run `pro vulnerability show <cve> --data-file=/tmp/security_issues_xenial` as non-root
    And I remove colors from output
    Then stdout matches regexp:

      \[DESCRIPTION\]
      USN-4976-1 fixed a vulnerability in Dnsmasq. This update provides
      the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.

      Dnsmasq has been updated to 2.79-1 for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM in order to fix
      some security issues.

      Original advisory details:

       Petr Mensik discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly randomized source ports in
       certain configurations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
       facilitate DNS cache poisoning attacks.
