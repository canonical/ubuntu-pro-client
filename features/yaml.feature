Feature: YAML related interactions with Pro client

  # Services fail, degraded systemctl, but no crashes.
  Scenario Outline: services fail gracefully when yaml is broken/absent
    Given a `<release>` `<machine_type>` machine with ubuntu-advantage-tools installed
    When I run `rm -rf /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml` with sudo

    Then stderr matches regexp:
      """
      Couldn't import the YAML module.
      Make sure the 'python3-yaml' package is installed correctly
      and \/usr\/lib\/python3\/dist-packages is in your PYTHONPATH\.
