# python3-apt
# We know it is in the distro, but for testing in venvs we need to install it
# And well, there is no pypi package
# We are using git-ubuntu to get the proper version by python version.
# We try to support the latest LTS, the latest released version,
# and the devel version.
# fixme: This may cause weird behavior in the future, or even break, if
# two releases have the same python_version.
