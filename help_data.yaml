      FIPS 140-2 is a set of publicly announced cryptographic standards
      developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
      applicable for FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI and ISO compliance use cases.
      Note that "fips" does not provide security patching. For fips certified
      modules with security patches please refer to fips-updates. The modules
      are certified on Intel x86_64 and IBM Z hardware platforms for Ubuntu
      18.04 and Intel x86_64, IBM Power8 and IBM Z hardware platforms for
      Ubuntu 16.04. Below is the list of fips certified components per an
      Ubuntu Version. You can find out more at

livepatch:
    help: |
      Livepatch provides selected high and critical kernel CVE fixes and other
      non-security bug fixes as kernel livepatches. Livepatches are applied
      without rebooting a machine which drastically limits the need for
      unscheduled system reboots. Due to the nature of fips compliance,
      livepatches cannot be enabled on fips-enabled systems. You can find out
      more about Ubuntu Kernel Livepatch service at
