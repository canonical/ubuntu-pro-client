      Common Criteria is an Information Technology Security Evaluation standard
      (ISO/IEC IS 15408) for computer security certification. Ubuntu 16.04 has
      been evaluated to assurance level EAL2 through CSEC. The evaluation was
      performed on Intel x86_64, IBM Power8 and IBM Z hardware platforms.

    help: |
      CIS benchmarks locks down your systems by removing non-secure programs,
      disabling unused filesystems, disabling unnecessary ports or services to
      prevent cyber attacks and malware, auditing privileged operations and
      restricting administrative privileges. The cis command installs
      tooling needed to automate audit and hardening according to a desired
      CIS profile - level 1 or level 2 for server or workstation on
      Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or 16.04 LTS. The audit tooling uses OpenSCAP libraries
      to do a scan of the system. The tool provides options to generate a
      report in XML or a html format. The report shows compliance for all the
      rules against the profile selected during the scan. You can find out
      more at https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications#cis

      FIPS 140-2 is a set of publicly announced cryptographic standards
      developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
      applicable for FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI and ISO compliance use cases.
      Note that ‘fips’ does not provide security patching. For fips certified
      modules with security patches please refer to fips-updates. The modules
      are certified on Intel x86_64 and IBM Z hardware platforms for Ubuntu
      18.04 and Intel x86_64, IBM Power8 and IBM Z hardware platforms for
      Ubuntu 16.04. Below is the list of fips certified components per an
      Ubuntu Version. You can find out more at
      https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications#fips

fips-updates:
    help: |
      fips-updates installs fips modules including all security patches
      for those modules that have been provided since their certification date.

livepatch:
    help: |
      Livepatch provides selected high and critical kernel CVE fixes and other
      non-security bug fixes as kernel livepatches. Livepatches are applied
      without rebooting a machine which drastically limits the need for
      unscheduled system reboots. Due to the nature of fips compliance,
      livepatches cannot be enabled on fips-enabled systems. You can find out
      more about Ubuntu Kernel Livepatch service at
