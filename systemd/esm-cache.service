# The ESM apt cache will maintain information about what ESM updates are
# available to a system. This information will be presented to users in the apt
# output, or when running pro security-status. These caches are maintained
# entirely outside the system apt configuration to avoid interference with user
# definitions. This service updates those caches. This will only have effect
# on releases where ESM is applicable, starting from Xenial: esm-apps for
# every LTS, and esm-infra for systems in expanded support period after the LTS
# expires.
