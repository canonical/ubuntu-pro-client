# On machines that are currently attached to Ubuntu Pro services, sometimes an action
# is required immediately after the next reboot.
# In those situations, a marker file is created that activates this service on the next boot.
# Circumstances that could cause this include:
#   - Upgrading from one LTS to the next LTS: to account for service availability changes between releases
#   - Pro FIPS images with outstanding apt hold on FIPS packages: to clear the holds
