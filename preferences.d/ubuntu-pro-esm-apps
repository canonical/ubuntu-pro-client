# This file is used by Ubuntu Pro and supplied by the ubuntu-advantage-tools
# package. It has no effect if Ubuntu Pro services are not in use since no
# other apt repositories are expected to match o=UbuntuESMApps.
#
# Pin esm-apps packages to a slightly higher value than the default,
# so those are preferred over a non-ESM package from the archive when the
# service is enabled.
