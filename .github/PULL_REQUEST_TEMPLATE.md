## Why is this needed?
<!-- This information should be captured in your commit messages, so any description here can be very brief -->
This PR solves all of our problems because...

<!-- By default, we rebase PRs and will ask for a clean well-organized commit history in the PR before rebasing. If your PR is small enough and you prefer, you can write a suggested commit message here and request a squashed PR. -->

## Test Steps
<!-- Please include any steps necessary to verify (and reproduce if this is a bug fix) this change on a live deployed system, including any necessary configuration files, user-data, setup, and teardown. Scripts used may be attached directly to this PR. -->

<!-- Example:
```
env SHELL_BEFORE=1 ./tools/test-in-lxd.sh xenial
# Set up test scenario before upgrade
exit # new version gets installed after exit and lxc shell is re-started
sudo pro new-sub-command --new-flag
# Assert something
```
-->
