.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "pro" " [-h] [--debug] [--version] <command> ..."


.SH DESCRIPTION
Ubuntu Pro is a collection of services offered by Canonical to
Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Pro command line tool is used to attach
a system to an Ubuntu Pro contract to then enable and disable
services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
described in more detail below.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "-h, --help"
Show help for pro or for the specified pro command.

.TP
.BR "--debug"
Redirect all the debugging logs to the console.

.TP

    * messages: Update APT and MOTD messages related to Pro.

You can individually target any of the three specific actions,
by passing the target name to the command. If no target
is specified, all targets are refreshed.


.TP
.BR "security-status" " [-h] [--format {json,yaml,text}] [--thirdparty | --unavailable | --esm-infra | --esm-apps]"
Show security updates for packages in the system, including all
available Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) related content.

Shows counts of how many packages are supported for security updates
in the system.

If the format is set to JSON or YAML it shows a summary of the
installed packages based on the origin:

    - main/restricted/universe/multiverse: Packages from the Ubuntu archive.
    - esm-infra/esm-apps: Packages from the ESM archive.
    - third-party: Packages installed from non-Ubuntu sources.
    - unknown: Packages which don't have an installation source (like local
      deb packages or packages for which the source was removed).

The output contains basic information about Ubuntu Pro. For a
complete status on Ubuntu Pro services, run 'pro status'.


.TP
.BR "status" " [-h] [--wait] [--format {tabular,json,yaml}] [--simulate-with-token TOKEN] [--all]"
Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro
support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific
support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

    * SERVICE: Name of the service.
    * ENTITLED: Whether the contract to which this machine is attached
      entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no.
    * STATUS: Whether the service is enabled on this machine. Possible
      values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles
      you to the service, but it isn't available for this machine) or - (if
      you aren't entitled to this service).
    * DESCRIPTION: A brief description of the service.

The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE
and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

    * AVAILABLE: Whether this service would be available if this machine
      were attached. The possible values are yes or no.

If "simulate-with-token" is used, then the output has five
columns. SERVICE, AVAILABLE, ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the same
as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the service is set
to be enabled when that token is attached.

If the "all" flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also
listed in the output.


.TP
.BR "system" " [-h] {reboot-required} ..."
Output system-related information about Pro services.

.TP
.BR "    reboot-required" " [-h]"
Report the current reboot-required status for the machine.

This command will output one of the three following states
for the machine regarding reboot:

    * no: The machine doesn't require a reboot.
    * yes: The machine requires a reboot.
    * yes-kernel-livepatches-applied: There are only kernel-related
      packages that require a reboot, but Livepatch has already provided
      patches for the current running kernel. The machine still needs a
      reboot, but you can assess if the reboot can be performed in the
      nearest maintenance window.

.SH PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on Azure and GCP) to
detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If an Ubuntu Pro license
is detected, then the machine is automatically attached.
If you are uninterested in Ubuntu Pro services, you can safely stop and disable the
daemon using systemctl:

sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service
sudo systemctl disable ubuntu-advantage.service

.SH TIMER JOBS
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed
recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides
which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run
successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.
There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchronize job execution
time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized
calls to the same service.

Current jobs being checked and executed are:
.TP
