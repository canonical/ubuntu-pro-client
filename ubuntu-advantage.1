a system to an Ubuntu Advantage contract to then enable and disable
services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
described in more detail below.


.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR "attach" " [--no-auto-enable] <token>"
Connect an Ubuntu Advantage support contract to this machine.

The \fItoken\fR parameter can be obtained from

The optional \fI--no-auto-enable\fR flag will disable the automatic
enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately
after a successful attach.

.TP

Remove the Ubuntu Advantage support contract from this machine. This
also disables all enabled services that can be.

service.

.TP
.B refresh

.TP
.BR "status" " [--format=tabular|json]"
Report current status of Ubuntu Advantage services on system.

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Advantage

support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

.BR "SERVICE" ":"
name of the service

.BR "ENTITLED" ":"
whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of
this service. Possible values are: \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR

.BR "STATUS" ":"
whether the service is enabled on this machine.
Possible values are: \fIenabled\fR, \fIdisabled\fR, \fIn/a\fR (if your
contract entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this
machine) or \fI—\fR (if you aren't entitled to this service)

.BR "DESCRIPTION" ":"
a brief description of the service

The unattached status output instead has three columns. \fBSERVICE\fR
and \fBDESCRIPTION\fR are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

.BR "AVAILABLE" ":"
whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.
The possible values are \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR.

Enables and install the Common Criteria artifacts.

The artifacts include a configure script, a tarball with additional

/usr/lib/common-criteria directory and the README and configuration
guide are available in /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-commoncriteria directory.

.TP
.B "CIS Audit (cis-audit)"
Enables and installs the CIS Audit artifacts.

See https://ubuntu.com/esm for more information.

.TP
.B "FIPS 140-2 certified modules (fips)"
Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules.

After successfully enabling FIPS, the system MUST be rebooted. Failing

kernel.

Disabling FIPS is not currently supported.

.TP
.B "FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates (fips-updates)"
Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules with
updates. Enabling FIPS with updates will take the system out of FIPS
compliance as the updated modules are not FIPS certified.

After successfully enabling FIPS with updates, the system MUST be
rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the
updated FIPS kernel.

Disabling FIPS with updates is not currently supported.

.TP
.B "Livepatch Service (livepatch)"
Automatically apply critical kernel patches without rebooting. Reduces
downtime, keeping your Ubuntu LTS systems secure and compliant.
