enable-fips \fItoken\fR
Enable the FIPS PPA repository, install the FIPS modules, configure
the bootloader and enable fips on the system. After successfully executing the
ubuntu-advantage script to enable fips, the system MUST be rebooted to
complete the enablement process. Failing to reboot will result in the system
not being fips enabled.
The \fItoken\fR argument must be in the form "user:password".

The following FIPS certified modules will be installed and put in fips mode;
openssh-server, openssh-client, strongswan, openssl, and the kernel
cryptoapi.

.B
update-fips \fItoken\fR[\fB\-y\fR]
Updating the FIPS modules will take the system out of FIPS compliance as the
updated modules are not FIPS certified. Enable the FIPS UPDATE PPA repository,
install the updated FIPS modules and configure the bootloader on the system.
If the system is installing FIPS modules for the first time, it configures
FIPS on the system. After successfully executing the ubuntu-advantage script
to update fips modules, the system MUST be rebooted to complete the update
process. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the
updated FIPS kernel.
The \fItoken\fR argument must be in the form "user:password".
The \fB\-y\fR argument is optional to bypass the user prompt and install updates.

The following FIPS modules will be updated and put in fips mode;
openssh-server, openssh-client, strongswan, openssl, and the kernel
cryptoapi.
