.SH NAME
pro \- Manage Ubuntu Pro services from Canonical


.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "pro" " [-h] [--debug] [--version] <command> ..."


.SH DESCRIPTION
Ubuntu Pro is a collection of services offered by Canonical to
Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Pro command line tool is used to attach
a system to an Ubuntu Pro contract to then enable and disable
services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
described in more detail below.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "-h, --help"
Show help for pro or for the specified pro command.

.TP
.BR "--debug"
Redirect all the debugging logs to the console.

.TP
.BR "--version"
Show the Pro Client version and exit.


.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR "api" " <api-endpoint>"
Calls the Client API endpoints.

For a list of all of the supported endpoints and their structure,
please refer to the Pro client API reference guide:

https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/references/api/

.TP
.BR "attach" " [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config=/path/to/file.yaml] <token>"
Connect an Ubuntu Pro support contract to this machine.

The \fI--attach-config\fR option can be used to provide a file with the token
and optionally, a list of services to enable after attaching. The \fItoken\fR
parameter should not be used if this option is provided. An attach config file
looks like the following:
    token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE  # required
    enable_services:        # optional list of service names to auto-enable
        - esm-infra
        - esm-apps
        - cis

The optional \fI--no-auto-enable\fR flag will disable the automatic
enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately
after a successful attach.

The exit code can be:
    0: on successful attach
    1: in case of any error while trying to attach
    2: if the machine is already attached

.TP
.BR collect-logs [-o <file>| --output <file>]
Create a tarball with all relevant logs and debug data.

The \fI--output\fR parameter defines the path to the tarball. If not
provided, the file is saved as \fBpro_logs.tar.gz\fP in the current
directory.

.TP
.BR "config set/unset" " <config-name>"

Set/unset one of the available Pro configuration settings.

.TP
.BR "config show" " <config-name>"

service.

.TP
.BR "fix" " [--dry-run] [--no-related] <security_issue>"
Fix a CVE or USN on the system by upgrading the appropriate package(s).

The optional \fI--dry-run\fR flag will display everything that would be executed by the fix command
without actually making any changes.

The optional \fI--no-related\fR flag will modify how the fix command behaves when handling a USN.
With this flag, the command will not attempt to fix any USNs related to the target USN.

<security_issue> can be any of the following formats: CVE-yyyy-nnnn,
CVE-yyyy-nnnnnnn, or USN-nnnn-dd.

The exit code can be 0, 1, or 2.
    0: the fix was successfully applied or the security issue doesn't affect the system
    1: the fix cannot be applied
    2: the fix was applied but requires a reboot before it takes effect

The optional \fI--unavailable\fR flag will only show information about unavailable packages

The optional \fI--esm-infra\fR flag will only show information about esm-infra packages

The optional \fI--esm-apps\fR flag will only show information about esm-apps packages

.TP
.BR "status" " [--simulate-with-token TOKEN] [--all]"
Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro
support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific
support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

.BR "SERVICE" ":"
name of the service

.BR "ENTITLED" ":"
whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of
this service. Possible values are: \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR

.BR "STATUS" ":"
whether the service is enabled on this machine.
Possible values are: \fIenabled\fR, \fIdisabled\fR, \fIn/a\fR (if your
contract entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this
machine) or \fI—\fR (if you aren't entitled to this service)

.BR "DESCRIPTION" ":"

The unattached status output instead has three columns. \fBSERVICE\fR
and \fBDESCRIPTION\fR are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

.BR "AVAILABLE" ":"
whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.
The possible values are \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR.

If --simulate-with-token is used, then the output has five columns.
\fBSERVICE\fR, \fBAVAILABLE\fR, \fBENTITLED\fR and \fBDESCRIPTION\fR are the
same as mentioned above, and \fBAUTO_ENABLED\fR shows whether the service is
set to be enabled when that token is attached.

If the \fI--all\fR flag is set, unavailable services are also listed in the
output.

.TP
.BR "system reboot-required"
Tells if the system needs to be rebooted

.SH SERVICES
.TP
.B "Anbox Cloud (anbox-cloud)"
Anbox Cloud lets you stream mobile apps securely, at any scale, to any device,
letting you focus on your apps. Run Android in system containers on public or
private clouds with ultra low streaming latency. When the anbox-cloud service
is enabled, by default, the Appliance variant is enabled. Enabling this service
allows orchestration to provision a PPA with the Anbox Cloud resources. This
step also configures the Anbox Management Service (AMS) with the necessary
image server credentials.

.SH PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on Azure and GCP) to
detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If an Ubuntu Pro license
is detected, then the machine is automatically attached.
If you are uninterested in Ubuntu Pro services, you can safely stop and disable the
daemon using systemctl:

sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service
sudo systemctl disable ubuntu-advantage.service

.SH TIMER JOBS
Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed
recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides
which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run
successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.
There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchronize job execution
time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized
calls to the same service.

Current jobs being checked and executed are:
.TP
.B
\fBupdate_messaging\fP
