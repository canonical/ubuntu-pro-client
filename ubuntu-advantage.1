.SH NAME
ubuntu-advantage \- Manage Ubuntu Advantage services from Canonical


.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "ua" " <command> [<args>]"
.br
.BR "ubuntu-advantage" " <command> [<args>]"


.SH DESCRIPTION
Ubuntu Advantage is a collection of services offered by Canonical to
Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Advantage command line tool is used to attach
a system to an Ubuntu Advantage contract to then enable and disable
services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
described in more detail below.


.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR "attach" " [--no-auto-enable] <token>"
Connect an Ubuntu Advantage support contract to this machine.

The \fItoken\fR parameter can be obtained from
https://auth.contracts.canonical.com/.

The optional \fI--no-auto-enable\fR flag will disable the automatic
enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately
after a successful attach.

.TP
.B collect-logs [-o <file>| --output <file>]
Create a tarball with all relevant UA logs and debug data.

The \fI--output\fR parameter defines the path to the tarball. If not
provided, the file is saved as \fBua_logs.tar.gz\fP in the current
directory.

.TP
.B detach
Remove the Ubuntu Advantage support contract from this machine. This
also disables all enabled services that can be.

.TP
.BR "disable" " [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]"
Disable this machine's access to an Ubuntu Advantage service.

.TP
.BR "enable" " [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]"
Activate and configure this machine's access to an Ubuntu Advantage
service.

.TP
.B refresh
Refresh contract and service details from Canonical.

.TP
.B security-status
Show security updates for packages in the system, including all
available ESM related content.

.TP
.BR "status" " [--format=tabular|json|yaml]"
Report current status of Ubuntu Advantage services on system.

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Advantage
support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific
support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

.BR "SERVICE" ":"
name of the service

.BR "ENTITLED" ":"
whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of
this service. Possible values are: \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR

.BR "STATUS" ":"
whether the service is enabled on this machine.
Possible values are: \fIenabled\fR, \fIdisabled\fR, \fIn/a\fR (if your
contract entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this
machine) or \fI—\fR (if you aren't entitled to this service)

.BR "DESCRIPTION" ":"
a brief description of the service

The unattached status output instead has three columns. \fBSERVICE\fR
and \fBDESCRIPTION\fR are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

.BR "AVAILABLE" ":"
whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.
The possible values are \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR.

.TP
.B version
Show version of the Ubuntu Advantage package.


.SH TIMER JOBS
UA client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed
recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides
which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run
successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.
There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchronize job execution
time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized
calls to the same service.

Current jobs being checked and executed are:
.TP
.B
\fBupdate_messaging\fP
Makes sure that the MOTD and APT messages match the available/enabled services
on the system, showing information about available packages or security
updates.
.TP
.B
\fBupdate_status\fP
Makes sure the `ua status` command will have the latest information even when
executed by a non-root user, updating the
\fB/var/lib/ubuntu-advantage/status.json\fP file.
.TP
.B
\fBgcp_auto_attach\fP
Only operable on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) generic Ubuntu VMs without an
active Ubuntu Advantage license. It polls GCP metadata every 5 minutes to
discover if a license has been attached to the VM through Google Cloud and will
perform `ua auto-attach` in that case.


.SH CONFIGURATION

\fB/etc/ubuntu-advantage/uaclient.conf\fB.

The following configuration options are available:
.TP

If set, ua will use the specified http proxy when making any http requests
.TP
.B
\fBhttps_proxy\fP
If set, ua will use the specified https proxy when making any https requests
.TP
.B
\fBapt_http_proxy\fP

config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy
.TP
.B
\fBapt_https_proxy\fP
If set, ua will configure apt to use the specified https proxy by writing a apt
config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy
.TP
.B
\fB<job_name>_timer\fP
Sets the timer running interval for a specific job. Those intervals are checked
every time the systemd timer runs.

.P
If needed, authentication to the proxy server can be performed by setting
username and password in the URL itself, as in:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  http_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<fqdn>:<port>
.fam T
.fi

.P
Additionally, some configuration options can be overridden in the environment
by setting an environment variable prefaced by \fBUA_<option_name>\fP. Both
uppercase and lowercase environment variables are allowed. The configuration
options that support this are: data_dir, log_file, timer_log_file,
license_check_log_file, log_level, and security_url.

For example, the following overrides the log_level found in uaclient.conf:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  UA_LOG_LEVEL=info ua attach
.fam T
.fi

guide are available in /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-commoncriteria directory.

.TP
.B "CIS Audit (cis)"
