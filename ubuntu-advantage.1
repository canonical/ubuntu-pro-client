services from Canonical. The available commands and services are
described in more detail below.


.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR "attach" " [--no-auto-enable] <token>"
Connect an Ubuntu Advantage support contract to this machine.

The \fItoken\fR parameter can be obtained from

The optional \fI--no-auto-enable\fR flag will disable the automatic
enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately
after a successful attach.

.TP

Remove the Ubuntu Advantage support contract from this machine. This
also disables all enabled services that can be.

.TP
.B refresh

.TP
.BR "status" " [--format=tabular|json|yaml]"

This shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Advantage

support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the
status of each service on this system.

The attached status output has four columns:

.BR "SERVICE" ":"
name of the service

.BR "ENTITLED" ":"
whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of
this service. Possible values are: \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR

.BR "STATUS" ":"
whether the service is enabled on this machine.
Possible values are: \fIenabled\fR, \fIdisabled\fR, \fIn/a\fR (if your
contract entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this
machine) or \fIâ€”\fR (if you aren't entitled to this service)

.BR "DESCRIPTION" ":"
a brief description of the service

The unattached status output instead has three columns. \fBSERVICE\fR
and \fBDESCRIPTION\fR are the same as above, and there is the addition
of:

.BR "AVAILABLE" ":"
whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.
The possible values are \fIyes\fR or \fIno\fR.
